# ReactJS Â» Components as Modules
[LearnJS](../../../README.md) Â» [CodeSandbox.io](../../README.md) Â» [React 101](../README.md)

## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a developer
Given the codebase of the "render-todos" challenge
In order to better organize my code
I would like to split my codebase in different modules
```

You can try things out directly on this sandbox:  

{% codesandbox id="ino1f", editorsize="60" %}{% endcodesandbox %}

**Tip:** look into `import/export` in Javascript (ES6), also, you'd better fork the
exercise into your own account as you will need to create new files!

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

This solution contains a files and folders structure that implement the 
**Single Responsibility Principle** at component level. 

Each component is responsible for just one thing, and
**delegates sub-responsibilities to sub-components**.

Take your time to navigate the codebase and read the comments carefully as they will
help you understanding what is going on and how I splitted the code.

{% codesandbox id="w8gzg", button="Proposed modules structure" %}{% endcodesandbox %}
