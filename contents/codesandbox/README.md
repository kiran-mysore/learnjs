# Introduction to CodeSandbox.io
[LearnJS](../../README.md) ¬ª [CodeSandbox.io](./README.md)

In this section of the roadmap **you will work with modern frameworks** such 
[_React_](https://reactjs.org/) and [_Vue_](https://vuejs.org/).

These are advanced tools that let you write a high-level code that looks like
_Javascript_ and _HTML_, but needs to be transformed into an executable form that
your browser can run.

[CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) offers a nice abstraction over this process
and let **you focus on the application that you want to build**, without bothering so
much with the tooling that you should install on your machine (we'll get to that
point later on in the roadmap).

There are a few more cool things about CodeSandbox:

- it uses Visual Studio Code under the hood, which is a cool editor
- it lets you play with multiple files and folders
- it lets you **share your app** providing a _URL_ for each exercise you do
- it embeds high-level tools for code quality and QA (we'll use them)
- it can connect with your GitHub account and edit stuff on your repos!

Long story short... it is almost to good to be real... and free!

A CodeSandbox looks like this:

{% codesandbox id="react-101-mzkeh", editorsize="60" %}{% endcodesandbox %}

In this embed you can look around the code, make changes and see the results live.

Of course it doesn't make so much sense to work in such a small area, so I strongly
suggest you click on the "open in new window" button to access a full-screen experience.

Before you move on into the challenges, I suggest you take the time to replay some
of the [CodePen Javascript challenges](../codepen/js/README.md) as CodeSandboxes, 
so you warm up with this new tool and get used to it.

## üëâ User Story:

```
As a developer 
Given a basic React sandbox
I should play around with automatic preview and reloads
```

## ‚úÖ Todos:

- Change the content of ‚Äúpublic/index.html‚Äù
- Change the content of ‚Äúsrc/style.css‚Äù
- Change the content of ‚Äúsrc/index.js‚Äù (the part that seems html)
- Upload an image and insert it into the HTML file
- Use the same image as background in a CSS definition

## üîé Go Deep:

- What is a ‚Äúpackage.json‚Äù file?
- What is a depencency?
- How can you share the result of your work?
