## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a developer 
Given a basic React sandbox
In order to keep my code simple and reusable 
I want to organize my React App into small Components
```

You can try things out directly on this sandbox:  

{% codesandbox id="gujv9", editorsize="60" %}{% endcodesandbox %}

---

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

- {% codesandbox id="u9gb4", link="The Gihpy Component" %}{% endcodesandbox %}
- {% codesandbox id="2lhml", link="Use the Spread Operator" %}{% endcodesandbox %}
- {% codesandbox id="hsjlq", link="Multiple Components" %}{% endcodesandbox %}

**Questions:**

- Why my custom components are `camel-cased`, while the basic components (div, img) are not?
- What is `eslint-disable-line`?
