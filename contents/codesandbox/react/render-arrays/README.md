## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a developer 
Given a basic React sandbox
  And a list of Gihpy ids
I want to show all the gifs in my main component
```

You can try things out directly on this sandbox:  

{% codesandbox id="ks380", editorsize="60" %}{% endcodesandbox %}

---

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

- {% codesandbox id="ryelx", link="Map components in JSX" %}{% endcodesandbox %}
- {% codesandbox id="xkpz1", link="Map into the function's body" %}{% endcodesandbox %}

**Questions:**

- What is the property `key` and what happens if I remove it?
