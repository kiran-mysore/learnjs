## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a user
Given a TodoItem component that accepts "value" and "completed"
I should see a visual feedback when the todo is marked as completed
```

You can try things out directly on this sandbox:  

{% codesandbox id="3g9i9", editorsize="60" %}{% endcodesandbox %}

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

- {% codesandbox id="idux1", link="Conditional style" %}{% endcodesandbox %}
- {% codesandbox id="vqo8l", link="Conditional class" %}{% endcodesandbox %}
- {% codesandbox id="hp8ch", link="Conditional components" %}{% endcodesandbox %}

**Questions:**

- What is the React's name of the `...otherOptions` piece of code?
