## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
Create a `TodoList` component that respect the following signature:

  const items = [
    {
        id: 'x1',
        text: 'buy milk',
        completed: false,
    }
  ]
  <TodoList items={items} />
```

You can try things out directly on this sandbox:  

{% codesandbox id="m1rbs", editorsize="60" %}{% endcodesandbox %}
