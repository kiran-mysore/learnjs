## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a developer
Implement a `data driven` todo list app that fulfill
the following user stories.

As a user
I would like to add custom items into a list

As a user
I would like to click on an item to toggle a "done" status
"done" items should be very small

As a user
I can click on a "hide completed tasts" button to filter
my list showing only the active tasks

As a user
I should not be able to add empty tasks

As a user
I should see a welcome message when no tasks are available
```

The architecture of this solution should always follow
the "data -> DOM" rendering pattern.
