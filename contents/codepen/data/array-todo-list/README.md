## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a developer
Implement a `data driven` todo list app that fulfill
the following user stories.

As a user
I would like to add custom items into a list

As a user
I would like to click on an item to remove it  
```

The architecture of this solution should always follow
the "data -> DOM" rendering pattern.
