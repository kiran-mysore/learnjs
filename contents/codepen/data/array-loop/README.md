# Javascript Â» Data Â» Loop through an Array

## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a developer
Given an array pre-filled with some items
I should be able to render this list as an HTML unordered list
```

You can try things out directly on this pen:

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

{% codepen id = "BaaVOVG", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}

In this second solution we achieve exactly the same result with a different
syntax.

{% codepen id = "VwwdGBr", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}
