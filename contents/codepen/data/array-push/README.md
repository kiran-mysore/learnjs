## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a user
I should be able to add items to my todo list
```

The architecture of this solution should be something like:

1. click a button to initiate the the action
2. generate a new piece of text like `item n.3`
3. add the new text into the array
4. render the new data
    1. empty the existing list
    2. add all the items from the array
